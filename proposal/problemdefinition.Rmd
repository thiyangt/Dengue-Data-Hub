Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has spread fast throughout the world, primarily in urban and semi-urban regions. More than one-third of the world's population lives in dengue-infested areas. The risk of spreading the dengue cases increases due to rise of population, changes in rainfall, improperly
managed waste water. There is no specific treatment methodology to cure dengue infection. Hence, effective prevention methodologies
reduce the spread of mosquito population and avoid mosquito bites. Earlier detection also helps to reduce
the severity of the infection and this may lead to mitigate the number of deaths in dengue. Therefore, understanding
the epidemiological patterns in dengue around the world is important.

For this first we need to take some photos of medicinal plants.

We will create a database and share the database through an R package. Researchers usually struggle and spend a lot of time to establish a database by gathering many leaf samples as raw data. By sharing our database we provide a training/test database to other researchers to evaluate their algorithm.  

However, many researchers struggle to find
comprehensive and valid datasets to test and evaluate their proposed techniques (Koch et al., 2017) and
having a suitable dataset is a significant challenge itself. On one hand, many such datasets cannot be shared
due to the privacy issues. On the other hand, those
that become available are heavily anonymized and do
not reflect the current trends, even though, the lack of
traffic variety and attack diversity is evident in most
of them. 

Yet, to our knowledge, no program exists that collects fine-grained Dengue data from around the world, including demographics, environmental factors, and other exogenous variables that have become available.

The goal of Dengue Data Hub is to provide the research community with a **unified** dataset helpful for dengue research.
